This is a pretotype for a game which tries to gamify maths learning.

There are 3 aspects to this game:

1. A visual feedback system to display the scores of the class/team
2. An Answer checker which checks for the correct answer and makes changes in the score
3. An adaptive tutoring system which uses Item Response Model to generate questions for the students just above their current level.
